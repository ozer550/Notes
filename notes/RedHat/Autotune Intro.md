- Complex microservices and cloud structure causes increased query time or slow queries in the software/ecosystem. 
- SRE's face problems with optimizing the run time enviroment for this ecosystem and clusters.
- Huge amount of tuneables which make optimization manually difficult.
- Size including cpu, memory, resources.
- Increasing cpu, memory, reosurce may lead to a huge cost.
- Autotune detects and tryies various different options intelligently and propposes a recommendation for the given performance objective function (in terms of YAML).
